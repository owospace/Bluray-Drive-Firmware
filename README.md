  <h2>About Bluray-Drive-Firmware</h2>

  This is just a collection of BluRay Drive firmwares<br>
  I keep these backed up in the event that I lose them<br>
  but also so they're available to the public.<br>
  The firmware itself is pretty self explanatory: they<br>
  enable LibreDrive on the hardware in question. Allowing<br>
  you to rip copies of your media library. (๑′ᴗ‵๑)<br>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  To get the project installed, follow this simple guide.<br>
  * ! * I am NOT responsible should you brick your drive.<br>

  <h3>Prerequisites:</h3>

  This project depends on the following:
  * [SDFtool or some other flashing software.](https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=22896)<br>
  * [An additional very helpful guide by billycar](https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=19634)<br>
  * [A compatible bluray-capable drive]<br>
  ```
    Asus 5.25 BW-16D1HT (SATA)
    LG 5.25 (SATA)
    LG BP50NB40-NB50 (Slim Ver.)
    LG BP60NB10 (USB)
    LG BU40N (Slim Ver.)
  ```
  <br>
  Optionally, you may also use MakeMKV for the ripping process.
  * [MakeMKV](https://makemkv.com)<br>
  <br>

  <h3>Installation:</h3>

  1. Unzip the SDFtool flasher and run the executable (or other software)<br>
  ```
    unzip SDFtoolFlasher.zip
  ```

  2. Select your drive from the dropdown menu.<br>
  
  3. Select WRITE firmware, locate and select the applicable firmware.<br>
  
  4. Hit start.<br>
  
  5. Start ripping your media library with whatever software you want. I use MakeMKV in this case.<br>
